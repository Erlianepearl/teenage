    <h2>Description of the Movie</h2>
    <p>
      The movie follows the story of a 15-year-old girl who feels unloved by her parents. 
      Longing for attention, she seeks it from her boyfriend, and their relationship 
      eventually turns intimate. This leads to her becoming pregnant at a very young age. 
      Expecting her boyfriend to stand by her, she is devastated when he pressures her 
      to abort the baby and then abandons her when she refuses. Hoping to find support, 
      she confides in her mother, but instead of comfort, she is told to also end the pregnancy. 
      Despite being left alone and pressured by both her boyfriend and her mother, she remains 
      firm in her decision to keep her baby, facing the heavy consequences of her choice.

    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
      We believe this film is important for teenagers, parents, teachers, and community 
      members. Teenagers can relate to the challenges of seeking love and acceptance, 
      while adults can see how crucial their role is in providing guidance, care, 
      and understanding to the youth.

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>
      <em>The Weight She Carries</em> is to raise awareness about the 
      struggles of teenage pregnancy. By sharing this story, we hope to encourage people 
      to be more compassionate, to break the stigma, and to open conversations that can 
      help prevent similar situations in real life.

    <h2>Learning & Prevention</h2>
    <p>
      As a group, we have learned that teenage pregnancy is not just about the choices of 
      the young person involved, but also about the support—or lack of support—from family 
      and society. To help and prevent these situations, we believe it is important to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encourage open and honest communication between parents and children.</li>
      <li>Educate teenagers about relationships, responsibility, and reproductive health.</li>
      <li>Promote self-worth and self-love, so that teens do not seek validation in harmful ways.</li>
      <li>Provide counseling and emotional support for those facing unplanned pregnancies.</li>
      <li>Work as a community to create a safe, understanding environment for young people.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>About the Movie (Group’s Perspective)</h2>
    <p>
        As a group, we learned that teenage pregnancy is not just about mistakes or decisions, 
        but about the absence of understanding and care that could have prevented the situation. 
        We realized the importance of open communication between parents and children, 
        the value of making responsible choices, and the need for a supportive environment 
        where young people can feel safe to share their struggles. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The lesson we take from this film is that every teenager deserves love, guidance, 
        and acceptance from their family and community, so they do not feel forced to seek it 
        elsewhere in unhealthy ways.
